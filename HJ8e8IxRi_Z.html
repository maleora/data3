				<p class="excerpt">
					 A American, Literature, Short Stories book. There is a time in the life of every boy when he for the first time...
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					This timeless collection charted a new stylistic path for modern fiction. Through twenty-two connected short stories, Sherwood Anderson looks into the lives of the inhabitants of a small town in the American heartland. These psychological portraits of the sensitive and imaginative of Winesburg&#39;s population are seen through the eyes of a young reporter-narrator, George Willard. Their stories are about loneliness and alienation, passion and virginity, wealth and poverty, thrift and profligacy, carelessness and abandon. With its simple and intense style, Winesburg, Ohio evokes the quiet moments of epiphany in the lives of ordinary men and women. Though its reputation once suffered, Winesburg, Ohio is now considered one of the most influential portraits of pre-industrial small-town life in the United States. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked it twenty-fourth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the twentieth century, and it continues to be read widely both in and out of classrooms around the country.

				<h3>More About <span>Winesburg, Ohio</span></h3>
				<p>The eighteen years he has lived seem but a moment, a breathing space in the long march of humanity. Already he hears death calling. With all his heart he wants to come close to some other human, touch someone with his hands, be touched by the hand of another. Sherwood Anderson, Winesburg, Ohio // It would be better to give up the notion of writing until you are better prepared. Now it&#39;s time to be living. I don&#39;t want to frighten you, but I would like to make you understand the import of what you think of attempting. You must not become a mere peddler of words. The thing to learn is to know what people are thinking about, not what they say. Sherwood Anderson, Winesburg, Ohio // On the trees are only a few gnarled apples that the pickers have rejected. They look like the knuckles of Doctor Reefy&#39;s hands. One nibbles at them and they are delicious. Into a little round place at the side of the apple has been gathered all its sweetness. One runs from tree to tree over the frosted ground picking the gnarled, twisted apples and filling his pockets with them. Only the few know the sweetness of the twisted apples. Sherwood Anderson, Winesburg, Ohio //</p>
				<p>Holy Moley! Virginia Woolf finds the very caverns leading to hell. Anderson makes miscellaneous dips in the very depths of actual fire... the residents of Winesburg all live there. They are the ghosts of the living. Anecdotes in Winesburg (devoid of time or protagonist) are juicy with implication and horrific details. They are grave,... Everyone and anyone Fuck, I loved this book...I loved its drab mood, and existential feel.I loved the descriptive writing, and the small town, midwest setting, with the seasons and people changing, but life in general, staying the same.I loved the wild brilliance to the endings.More than anything, and what made this novel truly special to me, was its insight...</p>
